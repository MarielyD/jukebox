Digital Jukebox

The purpose of the design is meant to simulate a digital jukebox. On landing,
an album should be auto-selected with the song list and it’s additional details
displayed below. Additional details included:

 ✦ Track number (incremental based on the way the songs are sorted)
 
 ✦ Option to mark as favorite
 
 ✦ Song Name
 
 ✦ Categorization (Explicit, Upbeat)
 
 ✦ Song duration
 
• The user should then be able to scroll through the carousel both in the left and
right directions.
